## Description
The simplest definition of Ideal Gas states that it is a gas that follows the model of elastic collisions between particles and assumes that there are no intermolecular forces between its particles.

In this code, a simulation of an ideal gas is conducted; it incorporates a histogram displaying the speeds of particles, thus demonstrating the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

## Technical considerations
For being able to execute this code, you should have installed the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries in your workspace.
